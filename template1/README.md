# An Experiment in creating objects

This is an experiment in creating objects. The private code and the
interface code is broken out from each other. Header files are used
to bind the two together. The public interface header is used so that
other code and access the object methods.

Both static and dynamic libraries are created. The dynamic library can be
used for distribution. This should allow for easier updates to the main
code base.

    Rerun of a paragraph from aaBuyMe.doc:

	Citadel is written in BDS C.  The distributed system can be
    installed and run without recompilation in most cases.  Citadel
    needs CP/M 2.xx, at least 300K of disk space, an auto-answer modem,
    and 64K RAM.  (i.e., a 0100 -> CF00 TPA, at least).  The source
    files run to about 150K, the .com files to about 100K.  In an
    operating system, the message and userlog files together take about
    100K, and one would normally like about 200K for message text, to
    keep the wraparound time longer than a week.

    If that doesn't describe your system, this isn't the file for you.
Either recycle the disks, or drag out the source code and documentation
and settle down to some serious hacking...

    NOTE: Data files created under Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 will >NOT<
work with Version 2.1.	The configuration file ctdlCnfg.sys also
differs from that for Version 2.0.  Sites running V1.0 or V2.0 should
start fresh with V2.1.

    Still with us?  OK.  For purposes of getting the basic system working,
you need to sort out and get acquainted with the following files:

configur.com	A special installation program.
ctdlCnfg.sys	(CiTaDeL CoNFiGuration SYStem file.)  You will edit your
		local system customizations into this file and then
		feed it to configur.com, which will do all the remaining
		work for you.  (Do you believe that?)
citadel.com	This is the actual Bulletin Board ("BB" hereafter) program.

    In order to get lost properly, it is very important to have a map.
Very briefly, the installation steps are:

    (1)   Edit ctdlCnfg.sys .

    (2)   Feed ctdlCnfg.sys into configur.com.	 Configur.com will:
       (A)  Create  ctdlLog.sys,   a file to contain all the userlog entries.
       (B)  Create  ctdlMsg.sys,   a file to contain all the messages.
       (C)  Create  ctdlRoom.sys,  a file to contain all the rooms.

       (D)  Create  ctdlTabl.sys,  a file which contains indices to the
				   first three files plus stuff derived
				   from the ctdlCnfg.sys configuration file.

    (3)   Run Citadel.com, which read the above files
	  and then let you enter messages, create rooms and all manner of
	  good things.


    Three steps.  How trivial can you get?  But please do study the
above carefully enough to get a feel for what's going on and an
understanding of what the major files do.

(1).
    So: go edit ctdlCnfg.sys .	It's massively self-documented,
just work your way through top to bottom putting in values appropriate
to your system.  You may wish to use a small message-file size during
testing to reduce the length of time configur.com takes to index the
file.  (It reads through the complete file each time it is run.)
    A few gotchas to watch for:
    Really, truly, all the instructions take hex values.  If you put
octal or decimal numbers in, it's not going to work.
    Configur.com is not very bright.  It wants to see blanks (not
tabs or carriage-returns) between and following all the fields it
reads.	On the other hand, it really doesn't care what happens on
lines which don't start with "#", or on the trailing half of those
which do.  If you end each instruction line with a comment and put
single blanks between the arguments, as I have, you should have no
problems on this score.  (BASIC programmers: don't worry, the comments
won't slow the system down.  Relax!)


(2)
    Run configur.com.  Configur.com expects to find ctdlcnfg.sys on
the default disk in the default userspace.  Once it has read this file,
it will shift to HOMEDISK and HOMEUSER.
    Configur.com is used to rebuild a system as well as install it.
When it fails to find ctdlMsg.sys, ctdlRoom.sys and ctdlLog.sys, it
will create them and remind you to initialize them.  When it asks you
if you want to initialize them (and then double-checks on each individual
file), type a "Y" each time first time through.  On subsequent runs,
you can answer "N", which will leave the three data files untouched,
only building new indices etc for a new ctdlTabl.sys file.  This way
you can reconfigure the system within reasonable limits without trashing
all existing messages, rooms etc.
    Configur lists various things as it runs, mostly to convince you
it hasn't crashed yet.	Don't worry particularly unless it seems
excited about something.  In particular, when it lists the modem routines,
it will list the opcodes of the routines but not the arguments.  Cheap
code?  Well, you get what you pay for...

(3)
    Run sysop.com.  It will expect to find ctdlTabl.sys on the default
disk in the current userspace when it is run.  It will then expect to
find everything else on HOMEDISK in HOMEUSER, with the sole exception of
ctdlMsg.sys, which it will look for on MSGDISK in HOMEUSER.  You
should copy all the .hlp, .blb and .mnu files in the distribution into
HOMEDISK in HOMEUSER, since Citadel.com will expect to find them
there.	(It won't crash without them, but you'll be missing all
the automatic hints etc.)
    Citadel.com will delete ctdlTabl.sys after it has
read it, and will recreate ctdlTabl.sys only when you exit.  This is
because it contains indices to the other three data files, and it
would not be good to load an out-of-date index file.  If
Citadel.com crashes, leaving you without a ctdlTabl.sys, just run
configur.com again to recreate it.
    Play around with Citadel.com for awhile: learn to enter messages,
create rooms, read messages, and so forth.  Create several different
identities, and log them in and out in rotation to see how new
messages and rooms with new messages are found.  (The system is much
easier to understand with lots of rooms and messages around to
experiment on!)

    When things are clearly working correctly, double-check the
modem routines and then try running over the modem.  You'll need to have
someone dialing the system up to test that carrier-detect etc are
working correctly.  This will probably be painful.  Note that you
can use "chat mode" to type directly to the modem, bypassing everything
but the modem routines.  You'll probably have to rewrite your little
modem routines in ctdlCnfg.sys several times before everything works.

    If you survive this far... congratulations!   and... Welcome!

=head1 NAME

qwk - A ANSI C class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include "qwk.h"

 int main(int argc, char **argv) {

     qwk_t *temp = NULL;

     if ((temp = qwk_create(NULL))) {

         qwk_destroy(temp);

     }

     return 0;

 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic class written in ANSI C. It shows a way to implement
object oriented programming. Why do this? It is a nice thought exercise. 

The files qwk.c and qwk.h define the class. 

=over 4

=item B<qwk.h>

This defines the interface to the class. 

=item B<qwk.c> 

This implements the interface.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 I<qwk_t *qwk_create(NULL)>

This method initializes the class. 

=head2 I<int qwk_destroy(qwk_t *self)>

This destroys the object. 

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to the qwk_t object.

=back

=head2 I<int qwk_override(qwk_t *self, item_list_t *items)>

This method allows you to override methods. 

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to the qwk_t object.

=item B<items>

An array of item_list_t data types. The array is 0 terminated.

=back

=head2 I<int qwk_compare(qwk_t *this, qwk_t *that)>

This method allows you to compare one qwk_t object to another. 

=over 4

=item B<this>

A pointer to a qwk_t object.

=item B<that>

A pointer to a qwk_t object.

=back

=head2 I<char *qwk_version(qwk_t *self)>

This method returns the version of the library. The version number
follows the guidelines from L<semver.org|https://semver.org/>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to the qwk_t object.

=back

=head1 RETURNS

The method qwk_create() returns a pointer to a qwk_t object. 
All other methods return either OK on success or ERR on failure. The 
extended error description can be returned with object_get_error().

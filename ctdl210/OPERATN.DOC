Citadel systems haven't had great reliability problems to date, but
reasonably regular backups aren't a bad idea anyhow.  An incremental
archive program is contemplated.

There's no proper way to expand the message files in a running system yet.
If you can tack the required number of empty sectors onto ctdlMsg.sys,
you should be able to change MESSAGEK in ctdlcnfg.sys, rerun configur.com,
and be off without losing any messages.  Best for now is just to start out
with as big a MESSAGEK setting as you need, and stick with it.

There's nothing compiled into the system concerning the number or structure
of .hlp files.	The system just looks for a ".hlp" file with the requested
name, and prints it.  Feel free to edit existing help files and add new
ones as typical points of confusion become clear.  Helpfiles may also be
put in directory rooms, of course.  A local-BBs listing probably makes more
sense as a .hlp file, while the full RCPM list would be a download file.

Pointlets:
 o  The system does a 20-sec wait on bad passwords, to discourage
    password guessing.	If you're establishing a new account, use a
    single-letter pw on first password prompt, and you can bypass this.

 o  The system converts messages from uppercase-only folks to lowercase,
    then does a simple capitalization algorithm.  This is lots easier
    on the eyes, but will confuse someone sooner or later.

 o  Be careful to leave the system in MODEM rather than CONSOLE mode when
    you quit playing around.

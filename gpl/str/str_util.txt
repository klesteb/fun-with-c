Author:    Alex Measday, ISI


Purpose:

    These are a collection of the string manipulation functions.
    Also, see the GET_UTIL functions.


Notes:

    These functions used to be part of the LIBALEX functions.  The following
    changes have been made:

      - Functions that take a length argument used to follow a convention
        that, if the length were zero, the function would determine the
        length by scanning the string for a null terminator.  This turned
        out to be a real nuisance if you had a need to handle zero-length
        strings ("").  The new convention is that,if the length argument
        is less than zero, the function will determine the length itself.

    These functions are reentrant under VxWorks (except for the global
    debug flag).


Procedures:

    str_cat() - a "logical" version of Standard C Library function strcat(3).
    str_convert() - scans a text string, converting "\<num>" sequences to
        the appropriate binary bytes.
    str_copy() - a "logical" version of Standard C Library function strcpy(3).
    str_destring() - resolves quote-delimited elements in a string.
    str_detab() - converts tabs in a string to blanks.
    str_env() - translates environment variable references in a string.
    str_etoa() - converts a string of EBCDIC characters to ASCII.
    str_insert() - inserts a substring in a string.
    str_match() - a string compare function that handles abbreviations.
    str_remove() - removes a substring from a string.
    str_tolower() - converts a string to all lower-case.
    str_toupper() - converts a string to all upper-case.
    str_trim() - trims trailing tabs and spaces from a string.
    strcasecmp() - compares two strings, ignoring case.
    strncasecmp() - compares two strings for a specified length, ignoring case.
    strdup() - duplicates a null-terminated string.
    strndup() - duplicates a string of a specified length.

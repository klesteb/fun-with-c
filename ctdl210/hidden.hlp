  Some rooms are hidden.  Initially, they are not listed by the <K>nown- rooms
command, and <G>oto will not take you to them.
If you know the name of a such a room,
you can reach it via ".Goto ROOM NAME".
Once you have visited a hidden room,
it will behave just like a regular room as far as you are
concerned: <G>oto
will automatically take you to this room whenever
it has new messages and it will show up
on your <K>nown- rooms list.
  These rooms are used principally for more or less private discussions. 
  They may also be used for a primitive roll- your- own adventure game, the
object being to guess the name of the next room from clues in the current room.
  These can chew up a lot of system time...

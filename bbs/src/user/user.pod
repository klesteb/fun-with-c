=head1 NAME

user - A ANSI C class to manage the user database

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the user database. This is used to keep track
of what individual users are doing. This is a fixed size file. The
number of users that are supported are defined when the database is
initially created. You need to delete the database for any size
changes to take effect.

This library is a class. It is extensible and overridable. It also makes 
use of the L<errors(3)> and L<tracer(3)> classes for error handling and 
reporting. 

The files user.c and user.h define the class. 

=over 4

=item B<user.h>

This defines the interface to the class. 

=item B<user.c> 

This implements the interface.

=item B<self>

A pointer to the user_t object.

=back

=head2 I<int user_override(user_t *self, item_list_t *items)>

This method allows you to override methods. 

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to the user_t object.

=item B<items>

An array of item_list_t data types. The array is 0 terminated.

=back

=head2 I<int user_compare(user_t *this, user_t *that)>

This method allows you to compare one user_t object to another.

A pointer to a user_t object.

=item B<that>

A pointer to a user_t object.

=back

=head2 I<char *user_version(user_t *self)>

This method returns the version of the library. The version number
follows the guidelines from L<semver.org|https://semver.org/>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to the user_t object.

=back

=item B<self>

A pointer to a user_t object.

=item B<user>

A pointer to a user_base_t type to write the data too.

=item B<count>

A pointer to write the number of bytes read. A 0 indicates end of file.

=back

=head2 I<int user_last(user_t *self, user_base_t *user, ssize_t *count)>

This method retrieves the last user.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a user_t object.

=item B<user>

A pointer to a user_base_t type to write the data too.

=item B<count>

A pointer to write the number of bytes read. A 0 indicates end of file.

=back

=head2 I<int user_get(user_t *self, int index, user_base_t *user)>

This method gets the indicated user.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a user_t object.

=item B<index>

The user to get.

=item B<user>

A pointer to a user_base_t type to write the data too.

=back

=head2 I<int user_put(user_t *self, int index, user_base_t *user)>

This method updates a user.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a user_t object.

=item B<index>

=head1 RETURNS

The method user_create() returns a pointer to a user_t object. 
All other methods return either OK on success or ERR on failure. The

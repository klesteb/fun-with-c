=head1 NAME

msg - A ANSI C class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include "msg.h"

 int main(int argc, char **argv) {

     msg_t *temp = NULL;

     if ((temp = msg_create(NULL))) {

         msg_destroy(temp);

     }

     return 0;

 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic class written in ANSI C. It shows a way to implement
object oriented programming. Why do this? It is a nice thought exercise. 

The files msg.c and msg.h define the class.

=item B<msg.h>

This defines the interface to the class. 

=item B<msg.c> 

This implements the interface.

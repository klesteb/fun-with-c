# snippets
===========

I first ran across snippets during the BBS era. It was distributed
over Fidonet. A network of associated BBSs using the phone system to
distribute messages and files. It is primarily for MS-DOS but there
are modules that can be used on other platforms.

This archive was downloaded from the internet, Summer 1997. I have
used pieces of this code over the years. The deque.[c|h] is the
ancestor of my que. que is a debugged and reformatted version. The
original version didn't survive a memory protected 64 bit OS like VMS,
but apparently worked great on MS-DOS. Which says something about MS-DOS.

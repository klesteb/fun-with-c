    Rerun of a paragraph from aaBuyMe.doc:

    Citadel is written in BDS C. The distributed system can be
    installed and run without recompilation in most cases.  Citadel
    needs CP/M 2.xx, at least 300K of disk space, an auto-answer modem,
    and 64K RAM.  (i.e., a 0100 -> CF00 TPA, at least).  The source
    files run to about 150K, the .com files to about 100K.  In an
    operating system, the message and user log files together take about
    100K, and one would normally like about 200K for message text, to
    keep the wraparound time longer than a week.

If that doesn't describe your system, this isn't the file for you. Either 
recycle the disks, or drag out the source code and documentation and settle 
down to some serious hacking...

NOTE: Data files created under Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 will >NOT<
      work with Version 2.1. The configuration file ctdlCnfg.sys also
      differs from that for Version 2.0.  Sites running V1.0 or V2.0 should
      start fresh with V2.1.

Still with us? OK. For purposes of getting the basic system working, you 
need to sort out and get acquainted with the following files:

configur.com    A special installation program.
ctdlcnfg.sys    (CiTaDeL CoNFiGuration SYStem file.)  You will edit your
                local system customization's into this file and then
                feed it to configur.com, which will do all the remaining
                work for you.  (Do you believe that?)
citadel.com     This is the actual Bulletin Board ("BB" hereafter) program.

In order to get lost properly, it is very important to have a map. Very 
briefly, the installation steps are:

    (1) Edit ctdlCnfg.sys.

    (2) Feed ctdlcnfg.sys into configur.com.     Configur.com will:
        (A)  Create  ctdllog.sys,   a file to contain all the user log entries.
        (B)  Create  ctdlmsg.sys,   a file to contain all the messages.
        (C)  Create  ctdlroom.sys,  a file to contain all the rooms.
        (D)  Create  ctdltabl.sys,  a file which contains indices to the
                   first three files plus stuff derived
                   from the ctdlcnfg.sys configuration file.

    (3) Run Citadel.com, which read the above files
        and then let you enter messages, create rooms and all manner of
        good things.

Three steps. How trivial can you get? But please do study the
above carefully enough to get a feel for what's going on and an
understanding of what the major files do.

  *    *    *     *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *     *    *    *    *

(1) So: go edit ctdlcnfg.sys . It's massively self-documented,
    just work your way through top to bottom putting in values appropriate
    to your system.  You may wish to use a small message-file size during
    testing to reduce the length of time configur.com takes to index the
    file.  (It reads through the complete file each time it is run.)

    A few gotchas to watch for:
    
    Really, truly, all the instructions take hex values. If you put
    octal or decimal numbers in, it's not going to work. Configur.com 
    is not very bright. It wants to see blanks (not tabs or carriage-returns)
    between and following all the fields it reads. On the other hand, it 
    really doesn't care what happens on lines which don't start with "#", 
    or on the trailing half of those which do. If you end each instruction 
    line with a comment and put single blanks between the arguments, as 
    I have, you should have no problems on this score. (BASIC programmers: 
    don't worry, the comments won't slow the system down.  Relax!)

(2) Run configur.com. Configur.com expects to find ctdlcnfg.sys on the 
    default disk in the default user space. Once it has read this file,
    it will shift to HOMEDISK and HOMEUSER. Configur.com is used to 
    rebuild a system as well as install it. When it fails to find ctdlmsg.sys,
    ctdlroom.sys and ctdllog.sys, it will create them and remind you to 
    initialize them. When it asks you if you want to initialize them 
    (and then double-checks on each individual file), type a "Y" each 
    time first time through. On subsequent runs, you can answer "N", 
    which will leave the three data files untouched, only building new 
    indices etc for a new ctdlTabl.sys file. This way you can reconfigure 
    the system within reasonable limits without trashing all existing 
    messages, rooms etc. Configur lists various things as it runs, mostly 
    to convince you it hasn't crashed yet. Don't worry particularly unless 
    it seems excited about something. In particular, when it lists the 
    modem routines, it will list the opcodes of the routines but not 
    the arguments. Cheap code?  Well, you get what you pay for...

(3) Run sysop.com. It will expect to find ctdltabl.sys on the default
    disk in the current user space when it is run. It will then expect to
    find everything else on HOMEDISK in HOMEUSER, with the sole exception 
    of ctdlmsg.sys, which it will look for on MSGDISK in HOMEUSER. You
    should copy all the .hlp, .blb and .mnu files in the distribution into
    HOMEDISK in HOMEUSER, since Citadel.com will expect to find them
    there. (It won't crash without them, but you'll be missing all
    the automatic hints etc.)

    Citadel.com will delete ctdlTabl.sys after it has read it, and will 
    recreate ctdlTabl.sys only when you exit. This is because it contains 
    indices to the other three data files, and it would not be good to 
    load an out-of-date index file. If Citadel.com crashes, leaving you 
    without a ctdltabl.sys, just run configur.com again to recreate it.

    Play around with Citadel.com for awhile: learn to enter messages,
    create rooms, read messages, and so forth. Create several different
    identities, and log them in and out in rotation to see how new
    messages and rooms with new messages are found.  (The system is much
    easier to understand with lots of rooms and messages around to
    experiment on!)

    When things are clearly working correctly, double-check the modem 
    routines and then try running over the modem. You'll need to have
    someone dialing the system up to test that carrier-detect etc are
    working correctly. This will probably be painful. Note that you can 
    use "chat mode" to type directly to the modem, bypassing everything
    but the modem routines.  You'll probably have to rewrite your little
    modem routines in ctdlcnfg.sys several times before everything works.

    If you survive this far... congratulations! and... Welcome!

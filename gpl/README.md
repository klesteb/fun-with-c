# libgpl
=========

In the late '90s I was searching the internet for C routines to handle
TCP/IP based networking and stumbled across this code. The license was
liberal enough so I downloaded it and ported it to VMS. I found a few 
bugs and reported them back to Charles. He thanked me, and life 
continued on. The original web site disappeared and I didn't think 
anything about that. 

Interesting enough, I found a bug in the nix routines and decided to
report it. So 25 years later I searched to see if Charles and libgpl
still existed. Low and behold, they do. They are now located here: 

[libgpl](http://www.geonius.com/software/index.html#libgpl)

The code is being maintained and extended. The nix routines have been
supplanted, so my bug report was not needed. But I sent a nice message
to Charles to let him know that I was still using his code.

**Note:** This code has been modified from the original code. Don't
bother Charles with bug reports.

This code was originally released in 1989 as "shareware". A reasonable
attempt has been made to contact "Hunter and Associates" for
permission to use this code. Unfortunately, after 35 years, they appear
to not exist anymore. 

I don't know of a protocol to handle this situation. I have taken this
code and made it usable on Linux from it original MS-DOS roots. It currently 
dosen't support file locking and concurrent access. These will be added in 
the future. 

This code fills a need for me. It may for other people. I will
provide support for this branch of the code.
